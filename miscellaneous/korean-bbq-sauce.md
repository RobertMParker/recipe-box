# Korean BBQ Sauce

Ingredients:
* 1 cup ketchup
* 1 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup honey - to taste.  It should be sweet.
* 3 tablespoons honey
* 2 tablespoons of apricot (or mango-apricot or peach) preserves
* 1.5 tbsp garlic gojuchang 
* 1.5 tbsp original gojuchang - (prefer Mother in laws brand for both)

Steps:
1. Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
1. Let simmer for ~2 hours to reduce.

Notes: This makes enough sauce for 1+ rack of ribs.  And it's not really Korean.
