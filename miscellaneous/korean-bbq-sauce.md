# Korean BBQ Sauce - TODO

Sauce notes:
Using original recipe quantities:
1/2 garlic goguchun 
1/2 original goguchun - Mother in laws brand for both.
1/2 cup honey - to taste.  It should be sweet.
Bring it to a boil, and let simmer for an hour to reduce. - TODO I think it's a lot longer than an hour
