# Korean BBQ Sauce

TODO - This recipe is heavily modified from the original, and I don't think everything is captured here.

Sauce notes:
* Using original recipe quantities:
* 1/2 garlic goguchun 
* 1/2 original goguchun - Mother in laws brand for both.
* 1/2 cup honey - to taste.  It should be sweet.
* Bring it to a boil, and let simmer for an hour to reduce. - TODO I think it's a lot longer than an hour

Modified:
* 3 tablespoons of honey
* 2 tablespoons of apricot (or mango-apricot or peach) preserves 
* 1 extra tablespoon of gc
