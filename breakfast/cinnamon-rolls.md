# Cinnamon Rolls

Notes 10/1/2023:
* Used active yeast instead of instant yeast. Let it hydrate for 10 minutes.
* Used machine on medium for 3 minutes with dough hook to knead dough 
* Made the rolls the night before. They did proof somewhat in the fridge. I took pictures.

Preheat your oven to 150°F (66°C), then turn it off. Cover the shaped rolls with aluminum foil and place the pan inside the warm oven. Leave the oven door cracked open for about 30 minutes, then close it and let them finish rising (another 30–60 minutes) in the oven with the door closed.

I intended to put it in the oven to proof quickly, but I left it on the counter an hour. Preheated oven to 160, then turned it off. Then proofed in the oven for 45 minutes, 30 minutes with the door cracked 
Baked at 375 for 37 minutes. Put the foil back on top for part of that. 37 minutes was a bit too long. Maybe 30 minutes would be good. The instant read thermometer reading for the middle and edges were different. I wouldn't wait until the middle is at temp, since there is only 1-2 in the middle, and much more on the edge. Better to have a soft middle than overbaked edges.
