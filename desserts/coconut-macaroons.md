# Coconut Macaroons

Notes:
* Recipe calls for 20 minutes of baking, but I made them bigger than normal, and I think the oven I was using ran cool.  So I baked for 20, took them out for a minute, and then baked for another 20.  When they finally came out, they had a little carmelization on top.  Still moist.
* I used melted chocolate chips for the chocolate, and I think that chocolate chips have a bit of emulsifier in them that keep them melty. I had to pop them in the fridge to harden up.
