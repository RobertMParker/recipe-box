Got this recipe from Sol Mountain, but it's identical to this one: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/coffee-cake-recipe/

Notes:
Baked 37 minutes, and the middle wasn't cooked, and collapsed after cooling.  Toothpick came out clean when I checked. Jiggle test next time.  Also consider an internal temp.
