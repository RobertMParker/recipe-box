# Apple Pie

Ingredients:
* 2 [piecrusts](pie-crust.md), 1 blind baked
* 3 pounds honey crisp apples
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons corn starch
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* Pinch ground cloves
* 1 lemon
* 3 tablespoons apple butter
* 1 oz either Heavy cream or milk
* [Whipped cream](whipped-cream.md) or vanilla icecream for serving

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees
1. Peel and core the apples.
1. Use food processor to slice the apples evenly.
1. Toss apples with sugars, corn starch, spices, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and juice the lemon. Fold in apple butter.
1. Transfer apples to crust and press gently to make sure fruit is tightly packed.
1. Roll out remaining dough disk. Use a knife to cut strips 1.75 inches wide. Arrange strips over the filling in a lattice pattern. Brush top of crust with heavy cream or milk. Sprinkle with granulated sugar.
1. Place pie on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil. Bake 15 minutes; reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue baking until crust is golden brown and juices are bubbling thickly, about 1 hour 15 minutes more. Let pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before cutting.

Notes:
* I didn't let the blind baked bottom crust cool completely, and it made the lattice edges all melty. 
* Do a light blind bake on the bottom crust, because it goes back into the oven to bake more.
