# Brownies

Ingredients:
* 3 oz unsweetened Bakers chocolate
* 6 tbsp butter
* 1.5 cups sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 tbsp vanilla
* 1/2 cup flour
* 3/4 cup chopped pecans

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350Â° F
1. Melt chocolate and butter in microwave.  Don't just nuke it.  Do ~30 seconds in microwave, stir, then repeat until chocolate is melted.
1. Mix in sugar.  This should cool it down a bit before adding eggs.
1. Mix in eggs and vanilla.
1. Mix in flour
1. Mix in pecans
1. Pour into a small pan lined with parchment paper
1. Bake for ~30 minutes.  Remove from oven while still pretty gooey.  They will continue to harden on the counter.
1. Let cool for at least an hour.

Notes:
This produces a smaller batch than the recipe on the box of Bakers chocolate, but these are much chocolatelier and sweeter.  Maybe even too sweet for some people.  Reduce sugar a bit if needed.
