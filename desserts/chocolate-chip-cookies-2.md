# Chocolate Chip Cookies #2

This isn't my original recipe, but I think I like it better.  And it is more forgiving.

Ingredients:
* 1 stick unsalted butter, softened
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips(I've been using Guittard. half semisweet chips, half super cookie chips)
* 1/2 cup pecans (optional, I usually leave these out)

Instructions:
1. Cream the butter for a few minutes
1. Mix in the sugars
1. Mix in egg and vanilla
1. Mix in the baking soda and salt
1. Mix in the flour
1. Mix in the chocolate chips
1. Refridgerate dough for at least a few hours
1. Scoop and form into disks by hand.  Really pack them, so that they aren't cracks.  This helps them bake more evenly.
1. Bake at 350 degrees for ~14 minutes.  They should be golden brown on top.

Notes:
* This is a half batch of the original recipe
* The original recipe calls for water.  With water, these are more forgiving in the oven(they bake longer), and don't brown as well.  If using water, take them out of the oven when they are still relatively pale. I like them without water, but you need to watch them closely and take them out when more of a golden brown.
