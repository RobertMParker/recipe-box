# Another Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe

Ingredients:
* 3/4 cup butter, softened
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 egg & 1 egg yolk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 3/4 cup all purpose flour
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 cups chocolate chips

Directions:
1. Beat the butter until light and fluffy.
1. Mix in the sugars, eggs and vanilla extract.
1. Mix in baking soda and salt.
1. Mix in the flour.
1. Then fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.
1. Refridgerate dough.

Baking instructions:
1. 3 tbsp per cookie, and press together into a disc.
1. Bake at 350Â° for 13 minutes until the edges are settled and the top looks fairly raw.

Notes: original recipe calls for molasses, which I didn't like.  Also added refrigeration, and slightly increased baking time to compensate.
