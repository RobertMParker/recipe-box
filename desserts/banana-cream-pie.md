# Banana Cream Pie

Ingredients:
* 1 [Piecrust](pie-crust.md) blind baked and cooled
* 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, divided in half, and chopped
* 2 1/2 cups cold [Creme Patissiere](creme-patissiere.md)
* Double batch of [Whipped Cream](whipped-cream.md)
* 3 ripe bananas, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
* More bittersweet chocolate bar, for making curls/shavings

Assembly Instructions:
1. Melt half the chopped bittersweet chocolate either by short bursts in a microwave. Stir until the chocolate has just melted. Spread the melted chocolate over the base of the crust. Transfer to refrigerator to cool for 10 minutes.
1. Remove the crust from the refrigerator. Spoon the chilled pastry cream evenly over the chocolate. It is not necessary to stir the pastry cream when you remove it from the refrigerator.
1. Take the sliced bananas and press them into the pastry cream.  Smooth it out.
1. Melt the other half the chopped bittersweet chocolate either by short bursts in a microwave. Stir until the chocolate has just melted. Spread the melted chocolate over the top of the pastry cream and bananas. Chill in refrigerator for 10 minutes.
1. While chocolate is chilling, make the whipped cream.
1. Top the tart with the whipped cream and finish with a sprinkling of chocolate curls. To make the chocolate curls, warm the bar of chocolate, but do not melt! Use a vegetable peeler and run it across the top of the chocolate to create the curls.
1. Chill the tart for at least 3 hours after assembly and serve the pie cool. (I pull my tart from the refrigerator about 45 minutes before I plan to serve it.) It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.

Notes: 
* The first time I made this, I made the chocolate coating too thick.  I figured that I couldn't put too much chocolate in it, but it hardens and makes it difficult to serve and eat. The chocolate layer acts as a barrier to prevent the crust from getting soggy
* The original includes caramel, but I just skip that
* I added another layer of chocolate on top of the pastry cream, and it's awesome. It becomes a super delicate crispy chocolate layer, and adds some texture.
