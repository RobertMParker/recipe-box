Notes:
* I cooked a 4.5# for a total of 11 hours.  I had two different stalls.  After the first stall(5 hours and 158Â°), wrapped in foil and put in 1.5 cups of apple juice.  I finished it in the foil in the oven.  it only hit 202, I was trying to get to 205, but I couldn't get it there.
* Plan for at least 2.5 hours per pound
* Better the next day, and easy to make in advance
* Do two at a time, it's the same amount of work
