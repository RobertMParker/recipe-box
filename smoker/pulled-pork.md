Ingredients:

* Disposable aluminum foil trays

1. Cover the pork butt in mustard and put on lots of rub
1. Preheat smoker to 250, while the rub adhears for 30 minutes
1. Insert the Meater probe
1. Smoke fat side up until 160 internal - Maybe 5 hours
1. Wrap in foil, add 1.5 cups apple juice
1. Put in oven at 250 until ~205 internal temp.  Should be probe tender
1. Take out of oven and rest
1. Separate liquid and fat.  Keep this liquid for adding back into the meat
1. Shred the meat, and add back some of the reserved liquid, keep the liquid just in case for later.

Rubs

Notes:
* I cooked a 4.5# for a total of 11 hours.  I had two different stalls.  After the first stall(5 hours and 158Â°), wrapped in foil and put in 1.5 cups of apple juice.  I finished it in the foil in the oven.  it only hit 202, I was trying to get to 205, but I couldn't get it there.
* Plan for at least 2.5 hours per pound
* Better the next day, and easy to make in advance
* Do two at a time, it's the same amount of work
* The last time I did two together, don't double the apple juice
* I did apple cider vinegar once, and it adds a lot of vinegar flavor to the final product.  Which wasn't bad, but it was unexpected since it doesn't add as much flavor to the pork ribs, but in that case the juice is discarded.
