I've done one brisket, so this is a write-up of that.  I haven't experimented at all.  If I was doing this again, I would cook it overnight.  And then let it rest covered in oven/cooler to keep it warm for many hours.  Instead of waiting to serve it when it's ready.


1. Trim + Rub - The night before
1. Wake up - 5am
1. Turn grill on at 225
1. Wait for it to come to temp
1. Put brisket on
1. Wait until 160-165 internal temp (5-6 hours)
1. Wrap in foil/paper, put back on grill
1. Wait - internal temp 204 (3 hours)
1. Rest meat to allow the liquids to be re-absorbed into the meat - at least an hour - meat should be ~140

Notes
* 18 pound brisket since that’s the smallest the butcher had, this took way too long to cook.
* I should have pivoted to something else.  We ate at 9pm instead of 5pm
* At 6k ft of altitude
* Added water pan to grill
* When moving brisket from the pan to the grill, I didn’t lift it up, and scraped a bunch of rub off of the bottom on the edge of the pan
* Cooked fat up
* Smoker's probe was ~15 degrees higher than instant read thermometer
* Wrapped in butcher paper, and it stalled for a long time, maybe wrapping in foil, and adding liquid would have expedited this.
* Grease bucket was empty until ~190 degrees, and then it started to render fat
* Let it rest for 90 minutes.  Some of that time was wrapped, and most was unwrapped.

Next time tips
* Get a smaller brisket, 12 pounds should be plenty
* Get in from the butcher more than a day in advance
* Cook fat side down.
* If on a timeline, Wrap in foil w/ liquid
* Let rest longer, and remove foil wrap, and tent with foil.
