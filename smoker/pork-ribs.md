Ingredients
* Rack of Ribs - St. Louis preferred
* Yellow Mustard
* Rub
* Heavy-duty aluminum foil
* BBQ Sauce
* 1/2 cup apple juice per rack

1. Cover ribs bone side up with yellow mustard. The mustard is just a binder and doesn't have any impact on the final flavor of the ribs. 
1. Cover in rub on bone side up first. Let set for 15 minutes. 
1. Flip over to the same to the other side. 
1. Wait for the 30 minutes, and preheat the grill.
1. Smoke at 180 degrees for 3 hours
1. Preheat oven to 280 degrees 
1. Remove from grill and wrap in heavy duty foil with pads of butter, brown sugar, honey, and 1/2 cup apple juice.  Crimp the edges of the aluminum foil so that it 
forms a very tight pouch. 
1. Cook it for 2.5 hours.  This will steam it, and make it super tender.
1. Unwrap the ribs, glaze with sauce, and crank oven to 475 for 20 minutes or until glaze is good.


Rubs used:
* Meat Church Honey Hog
* Meat Church Holy Gospel
* Aloha Spice Company - Aloha Pork+Chicken BBQ Rub
* St. Louis Rub?

Sauces used:
* Eileen's homemade Korean BBQ Sauce
* Bone sucking sauce

Modifications:
* Used Pineapple juice once with the Hawaiian Rub instead of apple juice
* Want to try glazing on the smoker
* I've done the steaming at lower temps, and for shorter.  This works best for me.  I like them tender.

Notes:
* Don't worry about monitoring temp.  Maybe test to make sure that they are probe tender, but a probe will poke a hole in the foil.
* Do at least 2 racks at a time, try three next time
