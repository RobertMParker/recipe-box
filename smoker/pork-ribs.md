Ingredients
* Rack of Ribs - St. Louis preferred
* Yellow Mustard
* Rub
* Heavy-duty aluminum foil
* BBQ Sauce
* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar per rack
* Butter
* Brown Sugar
* Honey

1. Cover ribs bone side up with yellow mustard. The mustard is just a binder and doesn't have any impact on the final flavor of the ribs. 
1. Cover in rub on bone side up first. Let set for 15 minutes. 
1. Flip over to the same to the other side. 
1. Wait for the 30 minutes, and preheat the grill.
1. Smoke at 180 degrees for 3 hours
1. Preheat oven to 280 degrees 
1. Remove from grill and wrap in heavy duty foil with pads of butter, brown sugar, honey, and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar.  Meat side down. Crimp the edges of the aluminum foil so that it forms a very tight pouch. 
1. Cook it for 2.5 hours.  This will steam it, and make it super tender.
1. Unwrap the ribs, glaze with sauce, and broil on low until the glaze is set.  Keep a close eye on it.


Rubs used:
* Meat Church Honey Hog
* Meat Church Honey Hog w/ Holy Voodoo
* Meat Church Holy Gospel
* Aloha Spice Company - Aloha Pork+Chicken BBQ Rub
* St. Louis Rub?

Sauces used:
* Eileen's homemade Korean BBQ Sauce
* Bone sucking sauce

Modifications:
* Used Pineapple juice once with the Hawaiian Rub instead of apple juice
* Want to try glazing on the smoker
* I've done the steaming at lower temps, and for shorter.  This works best for me.  I like them tender.

Notes:
* Don't worry about monitoring temp.  Maybe test to make sure that they are probe tender, but a probe will poke a hole in the foil.
* Do at least 2 racks at a time, try three next time

* 5/23/2023 - Used Meat Church Honey Hog w/ Holy Voodoo and apple cider vinegar instead of apple juice. And only glazed for 10 minutes.  These ribs were amazing, but there was a few spots of char on the bottom side from glazing in the oven with high heat. If I did 20 minutes as suggested, it could have been disasterous.  I want to glaze on the smoker next time, but it started to rain a bit, and I had already cleaned the grates.
* 4/17/2025 - Did two racks using no wrap technique.  Took it easier on the seasoning, which was a big improvement.  Still juicy(a bit less juicy). Better bark.  The hard part was judging when they were done. They took ~7 hours at 225. There are a lot of videos on "the bend test", that don't really explain it.  Pick up the ribs with tongs.  If they bend a bit, but don't start to rip, they aren't done.  These were good ribs.  I put the leftovers in the vacuum sealer, so I'll see how those turn out later.
