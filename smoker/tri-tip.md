# Tri-tip

Ingredients:
* Tri-tip
* Rub

Steps:
1. Trim as needed
1. Use olive oil as a binder and apply rub to tri-tip
1. Let it adhere for 30 minutes
1. Smoke at 225 until it has an internal temp of 130 - (probably 1.5 to 2 hours)
1. Turn off the smoker and leave open to rest
1. While the tri-tip is resting, pre-heat the grill for 15-20 minutes
1. Sear the tri-tip on all sides.
1. Internal temp should reach ~135
1. Rest for a 5-10 minutes


Slicing Instructions:
Cut in slices against the grain. The grain in a tri-tip changes directions, so watch out for that. 

Pairs extremely well with [chimichurri](../miscellaneous/chimichurri.md)

Notes 4/24: Pulled at 125, and it got to 130 while resting. It was good, but consider going a bit longer.
