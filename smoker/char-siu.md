Ingredients:
* 3 pounds pork shoulder/butt with bone cut out
  * It's way easier to buy this bone out, than trying to debone a pork shoulder
* Marinate ingredients - Eileen TODO
* Glaze ingredients - Eileen TODO


Steps:
1. Cut into 1 inch stick slices against the grain
1. Marinade for 4-24 hours
1. Preheat smoker to 225
1. Smoke for ~50 minutes - DON'T THROW OUT THE MARINADE
1. Baste with reserved marinade
1. Smoke at 350 until 140 internal temp
1. Baste with honey liquid
1. Smoke at 400 until >195 internal temp - It is not too fast, and they get some bark on edges.
1. Maybe flip at some point, the bottom gets more heat than the top at this point.
1. Let rest for >10 minutes
1. Slice on a diagnonal into thin strips.

Notes:
* There will be smaller and larger pieces of meat
* When smoking at low temps, the smaller pieces and larger pieces should be pretty even in temps
* When smoking at higher temps, the smaller pieces will come to temp much faster than the larger pieces
* Take the internal temp of each piece individually before pulling from the grill.
* Ususally come off the smoker in three batches: small, medium, and larger sized cuts
* The smaller cuts will be crispier around the edges and delicious, and the larger cuts will be more succulent
* Total cooking time for the thick slices was about 140 minutes, the thinner ones about 30 minutes less.
