Notes from cook on 2023/1/31:
* Didn't really have time for a dry brine. It sat for maybe 10 minutes.
* Used leftover basil aioli mixed with more mayo, sage, thyme, and a bit of rosemary.
* 30 minutes at 450, then 30 minutes 400, then 40 minutes 425. The final temp of the deep breast was 160. Could have pulled it sooner.
* Rested the chicken for a bit. Ate the wings while the bird was resting. Cut off the thigh+leg combo and ate, and let the breasts rest for longer.
* Next time, salt the chicken on one baking sheet, and then move it to a different baking sheet with rack. No foil. I would have liked to save the drippings, but the drippings stuck on foil and lots of extra salt that fell off when applying.
* Consider adding onion powder into herb mayo
