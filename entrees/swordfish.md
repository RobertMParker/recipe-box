# Swordfish

Ingredients:

For the lemon garlic Mixture:
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons garlic cloves, minced
* salt and pepper
* 1 lemon - juice and zest
* 1 tablespoon freshly chopped chives

For the Fish:
* olive oil
* 2 1-inch thick each swordfish fillets, about 6-7 oz each
* salt and pepper


Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 400
1. In a small pan, combine all lemon garlic mixture ingredients except chives. Put on stove under heat exhaust from oven to melt the butter.
1. Use paper towels to pat-dry all excess moisture from the swordfish fillets. Evenly sprinkle both sides of fillets with pinches of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
1. In dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Once oil is hot, add the swordfish fillets to pan and let cook until browned on one side without moving, about 3 minutes. Flip fish fillets over to the other side, turn stove off, and immediately transfer pan into hot oven.
1. Let fish roast about 5-6 minutes or just until the top is golden and center is just cooked through.  Aim for 125 internal temp.
1. A minute before fish is done cooking in oven, cook small pan of prepared lemon-garlic mixture over medium high heat, constantly stirring, just until melted and bubbly. Immediately turn heat off and pour mixture over the cooked fish. Be sure to pour on any juices from the swordfish pan as well.
1. Top with chives
