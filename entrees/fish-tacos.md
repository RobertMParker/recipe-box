# Fish tacos
First Base: Fish (throw everything in a bowl to marinate in fridge for like 30 min)
* Any white fish like tilapia, rock fish, or cod --> go with a fish with least # of bones and cube/slice to whatever size you want your bite to look like
* Get enough fish for # of people (~8 oz per person)
* Cumin - nice coat but depending on how much you enjoy the flavor of cumin
* Garlic - maybe a few minced cloves
* Olive Oil - just enough to coat for marinate
* Lime - 1/2 to 1 whole lime squeezed
* Hot pepper flakes - just a dash or two depending on your preferred heat situation
* Salt
* Pepper

Second Base: Slaw 
* 1 small small small head of red cabbage - shred like half of the head
* 1 small red onion - sliced
* Cilantro - however much you enjoy to see green stuff in a sea of red stuff (red onion and red cabbage)
* Lime - 1/2 to 1 whole lime squeezed to bring everything together

Third Base: Special Sauce (my guidance here is just to add small amounts of everything in a bowl first and taste as you go to see what your comfort level is)
* Greek yogurt or sour cream or mayo depending on your style
* 1 small can of this business (any brand can work but it must come in adobo sauce) and take 1 small pepper from the can (as much or little depending on your heat situation) and dice + scoop the sauce (just sauce) into your greek yogurt or sour cream or mayo business
* Lime - 1/2 to 1 whole lime squeezed to bring everything together
* Touch of salt to taste

Bringing it Home: 
1. Saute the fish in a pan for as long as you like your fish cooked
1. As the fish is cooking, you want to warm your tortilla in another small pan that's been lightly coated with some olive oil to give it some texture - warm it for as long as you want...the longer you leave it on the pan, the crispier it'll get
Take a big spoonful of fishy goodness and place in your choice of tortilla, add special sauce, and then the slaw on top
If you're trying to go low carb, just do it without the tortilla! 


I like to grill some corn in elote form too and have that on the side (https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/elote-mexican-grilled-corn).
