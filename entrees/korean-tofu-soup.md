Modifications:
* Used ground pork instead of pork belly
* I think we added more Korean dried chili flakes
* For poaching eggs, bring stew to a rolling boil, crack in some eggs, cover them, wait 3-4 minutes.  Pull them out first.
* Pair w/ grilled LA Kalbi from [Mama Cho's](https://www.mamachosbbq.com/).  With grill on high, just do three minutes a side.
