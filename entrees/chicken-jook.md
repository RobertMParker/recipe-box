# Chicken Porridge/Jook

* 6 cups water
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 1/2 pounds bone-in thighs
* 1 cup long-grain white rice
* 1-inch piece fresh ginger, skin on and sliced into 4 pieces
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
* Pinch ground white pepper, plus more as needed
* Coarsely chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish
* Thinly sliced scallions, for garnish

Instructions:
1. Place all ingredients except the cilantro and scallions in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
1. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook at a lively simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice has completely broken down and the mixture is creamy, about 1 hour.
1. Turn off the heat and remove the chicken to a cutting board. 
1. When itâ€™s cool enough to handle, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding the cartilage, bones, and skin.
1. Return the chicken shreds to the jook.
1. Stir to combine, taste, and season with additional salt and pepper as needed.
1. Ladle into bowls and top with cilantro and scallions.
