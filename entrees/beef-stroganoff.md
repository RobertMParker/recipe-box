# Beef Stroganoff

Ingredients:
* 12oz egg noodles
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter divided
* ~1.2 pounds ribeye steak - get a nice one
* 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 16 ounces crimini mushrooms sliced
* 2 yellow onion thinly diced
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2.5 cups beef stock - double strength using stuff from jar
* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* Dijon Mustard - never included, but Eileen wants to try it.

Instructions:
* Grill ribeye using standard technique and let it rest.
* Eileen likes it less salty, so try and scrub off extra salt.  Bouillon already has salt as well.
* Make the double strength beef stock
* Cook the pasta to one minute shy of the directions on the box.
* Add two tablespoons of butter to the skillet.
* Add the mushrooms and onions, and brown for 4-5 minutes before stirring.
* Cook another 2-3 minutes to get a good deep browned color.
* Add the last part of the butter and the flour whisking well, cooking the flour for 30 seconds.
* Add the beef stock and Worcestershire sauce to the pan and whisk until smooth.
* Cook for 5 minutes until the sauce thickens, then add in the sour cream and pasta.
* While the sauce is thickening slice the steak into 1/4 inch thick slices against the grain.
* Coat the pasta well then add in the sliced steak just before serving.

Pairs well with Peas and Carrots
