# Parmesan Chicken
Ingredients:
* 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 1 cup flour
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
* 1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
* Butter
* Olive oil

Prep:
1. Pound the chicken thighs until they are 1/4 inch thick with mallet
1. Combine the flour, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper on a dinner plate. 
1. Beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon of water in a large shallow bowl. 
1. On a second dinner plate, combine the bread crumbs and the Parmesan cheese.  
1. Coat the chicken on both sides with the flour mixture
1. Dip both sides into the egg mixture
1. Dredge both sides in the breadcrumb mixture

Can be cooked now, or left in the fridge for a day.  I usually cook 1/2 immediately, and the other 1/2 the following night.

Cooking:
1. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large (12-inch) saut√© pan over medium heat
1. Cook ~2 chicken thighs at a time for 5 minutes on each side.  Don't move them, just let them sit and get crispy.  Flip with tongs.
1. If needed, can be kept warm in a 200 degree oven.  Put on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet.

Serve w/ salad with lemon vinegrette dressing
