Instructions:

1. Combine all the ingredients for the dry rub
1. If it exists, remove the lining from the bottom side of the ribs.  A butter knife between the bone and the lining works best.
1. Generously coat the ribs with the dry rub
1. Put the liquid ingredients and grate in the bottom of the pressure cooker
1. Put the ribs into the pressure cooker
1. Turn the pressure cooker on High for ~34 minutes (this is fall off the bone tender, reduce time as needed)
1. 10 minutes of natural pressure release
1. Release the rest of the pressure
1. Carefully place the ribs on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet meat side up.  The meat may be falling off the bone.
1. Dump most of the sauce on top, but save some for serving on the side.
1. Broil in the oven for a few minutes to carmelize.  Watch carefully.  Donâ€™t let it burn.

Notes: Our pressure cooker can handle two racks at a time.  Each rack is enough to serve two people.
