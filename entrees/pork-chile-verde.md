# Pork Chile Verde

Ingredients:
* 2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch chunks
* 1.25 pounds tomatillos, quartered and husks discarded
* 2/3 pound Poblano peppers, roughly chopped, seeds in
* 6 ounces Anaheim or Cubanelle peppers, roughly chopped, seeds in
* 2 serrano or jalape√±o chilies, roughly chopped, seeds in
* 1 large white onion, roughly chopped
* 6 medium cloves garlic, peeled
* 2 tablespoons (15g) ground cumin
* Kosher salt
* Ground pepper
* 1/2 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves and fine stems, plus more for garnish
* 1 tablespoon fish sauce
* 2+ limes for juicing
* Tortillas and lime wedges, for serving


Steps:
1. Coat the pork in the salt, cumin, and pepper
1. Add pork, pepperers, onion, and garlic to the Instant Pot, and mix around
1. Cook in Instant Pot on high for 30 minutes, and then manually release pressure
1. Remove pork with tongs and set aside
1. Add cilantro and fish sauce to remaining contents of pressure cooker. 
1. Blend with an immersion blender or in a countertop blender
1. Season to taste with salt and lime juice
1. Return pork to sauce and stir gently to combine

Notes: 
1. Last time we made this, we used 3/4 pound of tomatillos, and it needed more
1. We used 2 limes for juicing
1. Roughly chopped makes it easier to pick up pork later, do not fine chop.
1. This makes about 4-5 extra cups of chile verde.  This is excellent on over easy eggs.  Or use it to make [enchiladas](enchiladas-with-chile-verde.md).
