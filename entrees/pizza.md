# Pizza

Ingredients
* Premade dough - 2 pizzas per dough
* Jar of Rao's Pizza sauce - enough for 5 pizzas?
* Low moisture mozzerlla

Potential toppings
* Pepperoni
* Burrata
* Sliced mushrooms
* Fresh basil
* Pesto

Steps
1. Leave the dough out on the counter for a few hours to warm up
1. Pre-heat pizza oven for >20 minutes. Should be at least 700 degrees
1. Clean and flour the counter
1. Stretch/rollout the dough on the counter
1. Sauce and top the pizza.
1. Flour the peel
1. Move pizza to peel, and re-stretch it if needed.
1. Slide the pizza into the oven. Let cook for 30-60 seconds
1. Pull pizza out using peel, rotate it 180 degrees by hand, and put it back in.

Notes:
* This is a messy operation, and easiest if done by one person.  Splitting the work over complicates things, and doesn't really save time.
* Pizzas cook quickly keep a close watch.
* Don't let the peel get hot, or pizzas will be more likely to stick.
* Don't make individual pizzas. Take individual requests, and serve to group. Otherwise too much waiting.
