Notes: 
* I changed the protein from chicken to pork butt and adjusted the cooking time
* 4 chipotle peppers makes for a spicy soup.  But consider adding more dried spices, it can take it. Also consider adding different peppers as well.
* Added dried passilo Chile. Soaked in some hot water. Cut off top. Cut in half and scrapped seeds out. Then diced it up.
* Makes 7 servings
