# Gatorade Spritz

This is our goto cocktail at home.  The name is self deprecating.  It's a joke!  There is **no** gatorade in it.  I believe this is technically a variant of a Vodka Rickey, but I didn't know that when I created this.  So we call it a Gatorade spritz.  It's very refreshing on a hot day.  Almost a bit too refreshing.

Ingredients:
* 2 oz Vodka
* 1 oz lime/lemon juice
* 0.4 oz simple syrup - Use the half oz jigger and just eyeball this
* A splash of lemon/lime lacroix

Instructions:
1. Shake in a cocktail shaker with ice and strain into a pint glass with ice.  
1. Pour in a splash of lacroix.

It should be a lemon-lime mix.  So the citrus should contrast with the lacroix.  i.e. If you use lime juice, use a lemon lacroix.

Notes: Adjust the simple syrup amount if you want it sweeter or less.  I don't like it sweet, but it needs some sugar to offset the citrus.
