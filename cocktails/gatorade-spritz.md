# Gatorade Spritz

Ingredients:
* 2 oz Vodka
* 1 oz lime/lemon juice
* 0.5 oz simple syrup
* A splash of lemon/lime lacroix

Shake in a cocktail shaker with ice and strain into a pint glass with ice.  Pour in a splash of lacroix.

It should be a lemon-lime mix.  So the juice should contrast with the lacroix.
